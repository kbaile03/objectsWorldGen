TABLETOP CONFIGURATION: 
    The tabletop configuration offers a diagram of tabletop surface with coordinates to more easily place objects on testing space. You can choose x and y coordinates anywhere in Gazebo space but the z-coordinate is set at table height.

ABSOLUTE CONFIGURATION:
    The absolute configuration allows more customizable placement of objects anywhere in Gazebo 3D space and allows for the addition of pitch, roll, and yaw parameters on the objects.
