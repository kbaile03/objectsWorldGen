objectsWorldGen README - Kennedy Bailey

Simple script to generate gazebo .world and .launch files

Output is three files: "world_name.world", "world_name.launch" and 
    "pr2_world_name.launch"

This output automatically includes Moveit's move_group.launch file so it does not
    have to be started separately when the pr2 component is going to be used.

HUMAN OPTION:
    If 'y' is selected, a model of a human is spawned at (0.5, 1.0, 0.0).

TABLETOP CONFIGURATION: 
    The tabletop configuration spawns a tabletop surface automatically,
        and offers a diagram of the tabletop with coordinates to more 
        easily place objects on testing space. You can choose x and y 
        coordinates anywhere in Gazebo space but the z-coordinate is 
        set at table height. Spawns flatter objects on top of unit boxes
        for easier discovery by vision.

ABSOLUTE CONFIGURATION:
    The absolute configuration allows more customizable placement of 
        objects anywhere in Gazebo 3D space and allows for the addition 
        of pitch, roll, and yaw parameters on the objects.

IMPORTANT:
    - Dependencies: 
        - ros pr2_gazebo package ("sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-gazebo")
        - gazebo_ros package ("sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo-ros")

    - Install Directories:
        - gazebo models dir must be: "$HOME/.gazebo/models"
    
        - pr2_gazebo package dir must be "/opt/ros/indigo/share/pr2_gazebo"
            - launch file is written here.
    
        - gazebo_ros package dir must be "/opt/ros/indigo/share/gazebo_ros"
            - launch file is written here.

        - gazebo worlds dir must be "/usr/share/gazebo-2.2/worlds"
            - world file is written here.

        - Note: If the program seg faults, it's likely that one or more of 
            these directories is incorrect.

    - Run: to run, enter 'sudo python objectsWorldGen.py' and follow prompts.
        In order to use a created launch file, one must catkin_make clean and
        catkin_make from one's catkin_ws.

    - Debug: If launch files do not run, try "killall gazebo", resetting your
        terminal, "catkin_make clean" and "catkin_make" from your catkin_ws and 
        ". ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" before roslaunching again.
